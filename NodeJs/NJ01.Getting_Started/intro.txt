Nodejs is a opensource Javascript runtime.
As this is opensource so we can see it's source code .

Nodejs is a server-side language.Thats mean it only can 
run in terminal not in browser.

Nodejs is a cross platform javascript runtime thats mean it can use in macOS,android,linux,ios
So we can crrate software for android and ios only writing code for one time 
than build for different platform.....

;) that's crazy!!!!
for example react native for creating cross platform mobile app
ios + android

electronjs is for creating desktop software for macOS and windows and linux
