Nodejs is a single threaded runtime
thats mean it can handle only 1 threat at a time 
nodejs can not handle multiple task at the same time 

if 1 task took 3s and if you have to complete 9 task
you have to wait 9*3=27s .

but in modern nodejs version we can increase this thread 
but it's a complex task to do.
we will learn it later
