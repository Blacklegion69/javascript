OOP = Object Oriented Programming

oop is a coding pattern to write c9de in a better and same way.
It helps us to make stabilisation in team work.So that
programmer's can write code in the same way that other coders do.

There are 4 pillars in OOP :
1 -> Encapsulation
2 -> Inheritance
3 -> Abstraction
4 -> Polymorphism

[Encapsulation]
------Centralise all common property and method
using class and constructor.Than create objects
by calling those classes using new keywords and
variables.

[Inheritance]
------After centralising all property and methods
we can call them to create object.
If we need the same object with some extra property or
methods we can extends them.This is what called Inheritance.

[Abstraction]
------Reducing implementation by hiding the actual algorithm
than make it user friendly. for example : Remote controller,
we don't know what type complex logic is working inside the
remote ,we just click on button to work with remote devices like TV or Toys.

[Polymorphism]
------Polymorphism occurs when we change something inside methods
after extended it.But one important rule is that the
return type must be similar to parents methods return type.
for example if parents method return an array than extended class method
must have to return an array.
