  /*
  ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification
created to standardize JavaScript.
  
 The Sixth Edition, initially known as ECMAScript 6
(ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015, adds
significant new syntax for writing complex 
applications, including 
ğŸ‘‰classes and modules, 
ğŸ‘‰iterators and for/of loops,
ğŸ‘‰generators, 
ğŸ‘‰arrow functions, 
ğŸ‘‰binary data,
ğŸ‘‰typed arrays, 
ğŸ‘‰collections (maps, sets and weak maps),
ğŸ‘‰promises,
ğŸ‘‰number and
ğŸ‘‰math enhancements, 
ğŸ‘‰reflection, and proxies.

 In other words, ES6 is a superset of JavaScript 
(ES5). The reason that ES6 became so popular is
that it introduced new conventions and OOP concepts
such as classes.
