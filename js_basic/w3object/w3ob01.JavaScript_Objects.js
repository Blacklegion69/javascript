/*
In JavaScript, objects are king.
If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥


⛔️In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

🧊 Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
🧊 Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
🧊 Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
🧊 Dates are always objects
🧊 Maths are always objects
🧊 Regular expressions are always objects
🧊 Arrays are always objects
🧊 Functions are always objects
🧊 Objects are always objects
💀 All JavaScript values, except 👉primitives👈, are objects.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
primitives 

JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

3.14 is a primitive value

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

Examples
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
symbol
bigint


🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Immutable
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.



🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Object Methods
Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

For readability, simplicity and execution speed,
use the object literal method.
